# Hilbert-curves
Program for drawing Hilbert curves using WPF in C#.
This program draws a hilbert curve to the size and recursion depth you specify.
I used the article I found below to base the Hilbert algorithm on.

I had originally used CoPilot to generate a WPF program for generating a
Hilbert curve, but the code did not work, but was close. I replaced it's
Hilbert code with the above articles and modified some of the WPF code.
The program is written in c# using WPF.
 
  Program features: 
  > Generates the Hilbert curve in a variety of sizes and recursion depths        
  > Has a dialog for entering information for the Hilbert curve generation
  > Can save the generated Hilbert curve data to a text file
  > Can save the Hilbert image to a PNG file
